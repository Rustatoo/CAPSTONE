Imagine Jesus telling you dear beloved remember in every challenge there is a hidden blessing God is with you guiding you through each storm with his enduring
love when doors close trust that God is protecting you and leading you towards greater opportunities meant just for you rejoice in your trials for they are
shaping you into who you are meant to be God's plans are always perfect even when they seem unclear surrender your worries and walk in faith knowing that you are never alone
pray with me Heavenly Father thank you for guiding my steps and for the unseen blessings on my path help me to trust in your perfect plan for my life amen feel free to share 
this with someone who needs a reminder of God's faithful presence may it uplift your spirit and bring you peace.

Good morning
hhhhh
